* This may suggest lower market penetration, fewer customers, or a need for better marketing efforts.

3. Stable Sales Trend with Seasonal Fluctuations.

* While no single massive spike is visible, consistent ups and downs hint at seasonal buying patterns or marketing cycle.

 4. Top Two Regions (South + Central) Contribute Over 60%
